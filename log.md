# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 

**Today's Progress**: I went back to practice in freeCodeCamp and rehash a few exercises of Javascript Basic Module

**Thoughts** I want to create an habit to code everday. While I don't think what project to do, I will continue to work on exercises in freeCodeCamp.

2. [Multiply two decimals with javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/multiply-two-decimals-with-javascript)
3. [Change a list with an array](./projects/javascript/change-a-list/index.html)

### Day 2: March 15, 

**Today's Progress**: I was really bad in code today. The exercise that I made, cost me more than 1 hour. After think in a solution, not so elegant, I saw the answer video and rehash my code. We this change, I could use the functions: 'splice, push, map and join' to work with my array. (In the my original code I not even used array).

**Thoughts** I have to study more of the 'new' functions in javascript, they facilitate so much that I can't even imagine.

### Day 3: March 16, 

**Today's Progress**: Today I forced myself to create the challenge from scratch. First I watch the video two times and then I code. Not work so easy as I imagine, but I get almost in the end without repeat the video. After I finish the challenge I comment the code most I can to understand more and to train my English.

**Thoughts** I am remembering Javascript. I stayed a lot of time without programming with this language, but with this challenge, I will remember and improve my skills.

### Day 4: March 17, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.
