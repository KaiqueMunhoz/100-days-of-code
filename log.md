# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 

**Today's Progress**: I went back to practice in freeCodeCamp and rehash a few exercises of Javascript Basic Module

**Thoughts** I want to create an habit to code everday. While I don't think what project to do, I will continue to work on exercises in freeCodeCamp.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Comment your javascript code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code)
- To
2. [Multiply two decimals with javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/multiply-two-decimals-with-javascript)
3. [Change a list with an array](./projects/javascript/change-a-list/index.html)

### Day 2: March 15, 

**Today's Progress**: I was really bad in code today. The exercise that I made, cost me more than 1 hour. After think in a solution, not so elegant, I saw the answer video and rehash my code. We this change, I could use the functions: 'splice, push, map and join' to work with my array. (In the my original code I not even used array).

**Thoughts** I have to study more of the 'new' functions in javascript, they facilitate so much that I can't even imagine.

1. [Change a list with an array](./projects/javascript/insert-into-list/changeList.js)

### Day 3: March 16, 

**Today's Progress**: Today I forced myself to create the challenge from scratch. First I watch the video two times and then I code. Not work so easy as I imagine, but I get almost in the end without repeat the video. After I finish the challenge I comment the code most I can to understand more and to train my English.

**Thoughts** I am remembering Javascript. I stayed a lot of time without programming with this language, but with this challenge, I will remember and improve my skills.

### Day 4: March 17, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.

**Thoughts** I read all the details of each exercise, it makes me improving not just the code but my English too.

1. [Divide One Number by Another](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/divide-one-number-by-another-with-javascript)

2. [Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/store-multiple-values-in-one-variable-using-javascript-arrays)

### Day 5: March 18, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.

**Thoughts** Today was tough to make this challenge. I arrived of a travel around two hours ago. Very tired, but I did some exercises in freeCodeCamp.

2. [Introducing Else Statements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/introducing-else-statements)

### Day 6: March 19, 

**Today's Progress**: Remember inheritance in Javascript, now much better than in the past. I did more freeCodeCamp exercises too, soon I will finish the Basic Javascript module.

**Thoughts** Javascript change a lot for me. It's more consise ans legible

1. [JS - Inheritance](./projects/javascript/inheritance/script.js)
2. [Introducing Else Statements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/introducing-else-statements)
- To
3. [Iterate with JavaScript For Loops](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops)

### Day 7: March 20, 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript module. Work with collections Map, WeakMap, Set and WeakSet.

**Thoughts**
- I had difficult to solve the problem 'profile-lookup'. I spent more than one hour thinking how to pass all the tests. In the future, I wanna do it again.
- Map
    - Has the methods size() and clear() and work with any properties types.
- WeakMap
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.
- Set
    - Has the methods size(),clear() and has() and work with any properties types.
    - Doesn't work with repetitive values.
    - Doesn't return the values, it just works to validate if we have an item or not
- WeakSet
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.

### Day 8: March 21, 

**Today's Progress** Complete five exercises of course 'Javascript: The good parts' in Pluralsight

**Thoughts** This course made me think about how we do not need to use everything in a programming language. A lot of resources tend to cause more errors than others. These resources are due to use with more conscious or even not to use.
