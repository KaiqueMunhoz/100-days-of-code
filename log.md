# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 

**Today's Progress**: I went back to practice in freeCodeCamp and rehash a few exercises of Javascript Basic Module

**Thoughts** I want to create an habit to code everday. While I don't think what project to do, I will continue to work on exercises in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 2: March 15, 

**Today's Progress**: I was really bad in code today. The exercise that I made, cost me more than 1 hour. After think in a solution, not so elegant, I saw the answer video and rehash my code. We this change, I could use the functions: 'splice, push, map and join' to work with my array. (In the my original code I not even used array).

**Thoughts** I have to study more of the 'new' functions in javascript, they facilitate so much that I can't even imagine.
