**Today's Progress** How to use simple methods of regular expressions in my code in Javascript and how to treat the bugs in my files. This was my day in #100DaysOfCode. In #Javascript30, the challenge was to work with checkboxes and figured out how to mark all of then when the shift key was pressed.

**Thoughts** In the #Javascipt30, we made a function that one boolean variable was assigned with the opposite of itself. I still thinking how this worked with that code.

### Day 18: March 31, 

**Today's Progress** I finished the module 'JSON API and AJAX' at freeCodeCamp. This module used JQuery and I didn't remember almost anything about this tool. Today, for things easy to do, I prefer plain Javascript.

**Thoughts** FreeCodeCamp could change the module 'JSON API and AJAX' to work with vanilla Javascript.

### Day 17: March 30, 

**Today's Progress** Today I finished the module 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' at freeCodeCamp. I spent about 2 hours to do the last exercise, but I could learn a lot with it. In #Javascript30, I used some new array methods like: find, findIndex, some and every.

**Thoughts** I passed the exam I made yesterday. Now I have to make a video to respond a few questions, like a job interview, and, if everything goes alright, they will give me one month of training.

**Today's Progress** Today I made a quick exam to work with frontend developer junior. Back to #Javascript30, we worked with a page that filters by name of city or state in a JSON document.

**Thoughts** It's holiday in Brasil, I wanna take this time to put my exercises in order.

### Day 15: March 28, 

**Today's Progress** Today I stuck on the 'Mutation' exercise of the freeCodeCamp. Besides that, I made 2 more exercises and work for the first time with flexbox CSS. The Day 5 of #Javascript30 not have so much Javascript but the flexbox worth it.

**Thoughts** I liked so much the facility of the flexbox. In a near future, I want to learn more about this tool.

### Day 14: March 27, 

**Today's Progress** Today was a day to practice arrays in Javascript. In freeCodeCamp I made more 3 exercises. In #Javascript30 challenge the exercises were more specific in functions: map, reduce, filter, sort.

**Thoughts** I understood a little more the function 'sort', but I still have a problem to figured out how I will put the number positive or negative to ordinate in a way I pretend. I learned something new in the function reduce. I didn't know that the second param, after the callback function, was the initial value of the first param in the callback.function.

### Day 13: March 26, 

**Today's Progress** I came back to the freeCodeCamp. I continued the Basic Algorithm Scripting module and made 4 more exercises. Besides that, I worked with CSS variables and learn how to manipulate them with Javascript.

**Thoughts** Like I thought yesterday, CSS3 is really fantastic and I have to study more this incredible tool. These variables make the code so easy to read and even to work with.

### Day 12: March 25, 

**Today's Progress** Today I made a clock. Following the videos of # Javascript30 in this lesson we used the class Javascript Date. With a few CSS transform and manipulating the transition of the pointers, the page was until good.

**Thoughts** I realized that I have to study more CSS3. Things like 'transform' and 'transition' give much power to the developer, and I am not so familiarized with these properties.

### Day 11: March 24, 

**Today's Progress** Today I started the 30 days javascript challenge. Making this challenge together with 100 days of code, I hope to improve my Javascript skill much more.In the first day of this new challenge, I coded a page that simulated a drum kit.

**Thoughts** Now the exercises for the next 30 days will be more beautiful because this other challenge gives the files with HTML and CSS done.

### Day 10: March 23, 

**Today's Progress** I complete the Basic Javascript and Object Oriented and Functional Programming Modules on the freeCodeCamp and begin the challenges of the module: Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** The day was productive. I got it stay two uninterrupted hours in freeCodeCamp and this helped me make a lot of exercises.

### Day 9: March 22, 

**Today's Progress** I study ES6 and made some annotations to remember and fixed in my mind.

**Thoughts** How to pass parameters of a child class to the father class? In the exercises of Rocketseat ES6 course, exists a question that needs this. I wonder how to do this.

1. [ES6 Anotations](./projects/rocketseat/course/main.js)


### Day 8: March 21, 

**Today's Progress** Complete five exercises of course 'Javascript: The good parts' in Pluralsight

**Thoughts** This course made me think about how we do not need to use everything in a programming language. A lot of resources tend to cause more errors than others. These resources are due to use with more conscious or even not to use.

### Day 7: March 20, 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript module. Work with collections Map, WeakMap, Set and WeakSet.

**Thoughts**
- I had difficult to solve the problem 'profile-lookup'. I spent more than one hour thinking how to pass all the tests. In the future, I wanna do it again.
- Map
    - Has the methods size() and clear() and work with any properties types.
- WeakMap
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.
- Set
    - Has the methods size(),clear() and has() and work with any properties types.
    - Doesn't work with repetitive values.
    - Doesn't return the values, it just works to validate if we have an item or not
- WeakSet
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.

### Day 4: March 17, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.

**Thoughts** I read all the details of each exercise, it makes me improving not just the code but my English too.

### Day 3: March 16, 

**Today's Progress**: Today I forced myself to create the challenge from scratch. First I watch the video two times and then I code. Not work so easy as I imagine, but I get almost in the end without repeat the video. After I finish the challenge I comment the code most I can to understand more and to train my English.

**Thoughts** I am remembering Javascript. I stayed a lot of time without programming with this language, but with this challenge, I will remember and improve my skills.

### Day 2: March 15, 

**Today's Progress**: I was really bad in code today. The exercise that I made, cost me more than 1 hour. After think in a solution, not so elegant, I saw the answer video and rehash my code. We this change, I could use the functions: 'splice, push, map and join' to work with my array. (In the my original code I not even used array).

**Thoughts** I have to study more of the 'new' functions in javascript, they facilitate so much that I can't even imagine.

### Day 1: March 14, 

**Today's Progress**: I went back to practice in freeCodeCamp and rehash a few exercises of Javascript Basic Module

**Thoughts** I want to create an habit to code everday. While I don't think what project to do, I will continue to work on exercises in freeCodeCamp.
