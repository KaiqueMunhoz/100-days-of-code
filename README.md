# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1

### Day 12: March 25, 

**Today's Progress** Today I made a clock. Following the videos of # Javascript30 in this lesson we used the class Javascript Date. With a few CSS transform and manipulating the transition of the pointers, the page was until good.

**Thoughts** I realized that I have to study more CSS3. Things like 'transform' and 'transition' give much power to the developer, and I am not so familiarized with these properties.

### Day 11: March 24, 

**Today's Progress** Today I started the 30 days javascript challenge. Making this challenge together with 100 days of code, I hope to improve my Javascript skill much more.In the first day of this new challenge, I coded a page that simulated a drum kit.

**Thoughts** Now the exercises for the next 30 days will be more beautiful because this other challenge gives the files with HTML and CSS done.

### Day 10: March 23, 

**Today's Progress** I complete the Basic Javascript and Object Oriented and Functional Programming Modules on the freeCodeCamp and begin the challenges of the module: Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** The day was productive. I got it stay two uninterrupted hours in freeCodeCamp and this helped me make a lot of exercises.

### Day 9: March 22, 

**Today's Progress** I study ES6 and made some annotations to remember and fixed in my mind.

**Thoughts** How to pass parameters of a child class to the father class? In the exercises of Rocketseat ES6 course, exists a question that needs this. I wonder how to do this.

### Day 8: March 21, 

**Today's Progress** Complete five exercises of course 'Javascript: The good parts' in Pluralsight

**Thoughts** This course made me think about how we do not need to use everything in a programming language. A lot of resources tend to cause more errors than others. These resources are due to use with more conscious or even not to use.

### Day 7: March 20, 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript module. Work with collections Map, WeakMap, Set and WeakSet.

**Thoughts**
- I had difficult to solve the problem 'profile-lookup'. I spent more than one hour thinking how to pass all the tests. In the future, I wanna do it again.
- Map
    - Has the methods size() and clear() and work with any properties types.
- WeakMap
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.
- Set
    - Has the methods size(),clear() and has() and work with any properties types.
    - Doesn't work with repetitive values.
    - Doesn't return the values, it just works to validate if we have an item or not
- WeakSet
    - Hasn't the methods size() and clear() and just work with properties which are objects.

### Day 6: March 19, 

**Today's Progress**: Remember inheritance in Javascript, now much better than in the past. I did more freeCodeCamp exercises too, soon I will finish the Basic Javascript module.

**Thoughts** Javascript change a lot for me. It's more consise ans legible

### Day 5: March 18, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.

**Thoughts** Today was tough to make this challenge. I arrived of a travel around two hours ago. Very tired, but I did some exercises in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: March 17, 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the freeCodeCamp, I continued to do the exercises to complete the module of Javascript.

**Thoughts** I read all the details of each exercise, it makes me improving not just the code but my English too.

### Day 3: March 16, 

**Today's Progress**: Today I forced myself to create the challenge from scratch. First I watch the video two times and then I code. Not work so easy as I imagine, but I get almost in the end without repeat the video. After I finish the challenge I comment the code most I can to understand more and to train my English.

**Thoughts** I am remembering Javascript. I stayed a lot of time without programming with this language, but with this challenge, I will remember and improve my skills.

### Day 2: March 15, 

**Today's Progress**: I was really bad in code today. The exercise that I made, cost me more than 1 hour. After think in a solution, not so elegant, I saw the answer video and rehash my code. We this change, I could use the functions: 'splice, push, map and join' to work with my array. (In the my original code I not even used array).

**Thoughts** I have to study more of the 'new' functions in javascript, they facilitate so much that I can't even imagine.

### Day 1: March 14, 

**Today's Progress**: I went back to practice in freeCodeCamp and rehash a few exercises of Javascript Basic Module

**Thoughts** I want to create an habit to code everday. While I don't think what project to do, I will continue to work on exercises in freeCodeCamp.
